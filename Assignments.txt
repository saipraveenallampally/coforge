--RDBMS
	RDBMS stands for Relational DataBase Management System.
 ->All modern database management systems like SQL, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, ORACLE, My-SQL and Microsoft Access are based on RDBMS.
 ->It is called Relational Data Base Management System (RDBMS) because it is based on relational model introduced by E.F. Codd.
The RDBMS database uses tables to store data. A table is a collection of related data entries and contains rows and columns to store data.
 A table is the simplest example of data storage in RDBMS.
